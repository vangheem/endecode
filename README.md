# (en|de)code

I often find myself googling a site that will encode base64 or url decode a value.
The top results for this have been getting worse: full of ads, tracking cookies and clunky user interfaces.

[endecode.org](https://endecode.org) is an open source tool for encoding and decoding text online.
