# (en|de)code

I often find myself googling a site that will encode base64 for me or url decode a value.
The top results on sites for this have been getting worse with ads, tracking cookies and clunky user interfaces.

[endecode.org](https://endecode.org) is a simple, open source tool for encoding and decoding text online.
